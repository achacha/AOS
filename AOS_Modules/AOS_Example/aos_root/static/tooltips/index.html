, 
<span id="PygmyMarmoset" class="tooltipable" onmouseover="return getHttpXml(this.id);" onmouseout="return nd();">Pygmy "Unleaded" Marmoset</span>
, and
<span id="WhiteHeadedMarmoset" class="tooltipable" onmouseover="return getHttpXml(this.id);" onmouseout="return nd();">White Headed "Diesel" Marmoset</span>

the ferocious beast called a 
<span id="Chihuahua" class="tooltipable" onmouseover="return getHttpXml(this.id);" onmouseout="return nd();">Ferocious Desert Chihuahua</span>

3. One cannot easily describe the sheer destructive prowess of the infamous
<span id="TwoToedSloth" class="tooltipable" onmouseover="return getHttpXml(this.id);" onmouseout="return nd();">Two Toed Death Sloth</span>
.  A globally feared predator, easily annihilating prey, swooping down from above and just as quickly retracting to prepare for the next attack.

4. The 
<span id="Koala" class="tooltipable" onmouseover="return getHttpXml(this.id);" onmouseout="return nd();">Koala</span>
is a notoriously known as "The Plunder From Downunder".  Vicious, remorseless and overall unpleasant.  Many stories were told of the
sheer devastation caused by one relatively hungry koala that decided that savaging one Eucalyptus tree was not enough.  Generations still
feel the effects of that incident.
