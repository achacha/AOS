<br/>
FrontPage Server Extensions ship as part of IIS 4.0 and 5.0, and facilitate the development of Web sites and Web-based applications. FrontPage Server Extensions includes an additional, optional sub-component called Visual Studio RAD (Remote Application Deployment) Support. This sub-component allows Visual InterDev 6.0 users to register and unregister COM objects on an IIS 4.0 or 5.0 Server. This sub-component suffers from a buffer overflow vulnerability in a section that processes input information.<br/>
<br/>
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability against any server with this sub-component installed by establishing a web session on with the server and passing a malformed packet to the server component. The attacker could use that packet to thereby load code of his choice for execution on the server. An attack that exploits this vulnerability would execute in the IUSR_machinename context (see Q142868). However, it is possible under certain circumstances to execute code in the SYSTEM context.<br/>
