Creating a new AOS_Modules project:

1. In you AOS_Modules directory execute:

  new_AOS_Project.py {Name of the project} {Name of a module in this project}
	
	Example:
	  new_AOS_Project.py Sample HelloWorld
		
  This will create a new project AOS_Sample and add a simple module called AOSModule_HelloWorld.hpp and AOSModule_HelloWorld.hpp.
	It will also add glue code to register a module called "HelloWorld"

2. In MS Visual Studio from Solution window:

  Add | Existing Project...

3. Set correct dependencies (if this is a stand-alone project, this step is not needed)

4. Let AObjectServer know that it now needs to load this library:
  in aos_root/conf/AObjectServer.xml add entry for your module
	  <load>
		  ...
			<Module>AOS_Sample</Module>
		</load>

When AObjectServer restarts it will load you library and execute aos_register() in AOS_Sample.cpp which registers it.
