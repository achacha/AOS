<p>What I see is the seasonal chug at midnight soporific tantrum hazelnut
amphetamine sunrise. I know what you mean. The fear thing bleary sports
caps in waving flisps of tender acres crossed with Adirondack toothache
amphetamine gargoyle raps...lemme just do 49 hours in a chrome canoe with
the Hair Girl.</p>

<p> Polished the hubs. The fear bleary waves at itself in a gallery window
filled with carved air balls. On The Cross was the weight that ran their
clock down the purple pearls of these aluminum hormones. They ran into
the pile of empty bottles and began throwing them at the adulteress. Each
of them was able to pitch a peanut across the English Channel with the
wind against 'em.</p>

<p> Christ was pushed into a wood chipper as his little shreds of meat
and the smell of cedar came flying out against the French nuns standing
at attention beside their blackboards, each menstruating heavily. </p>

<p>I wanted to compress Picasso, Stravinsky, Elliot, Moore and Maughm,
but all I could do was force Arthur Godfrey to pee on a picture of himself.
It would have to do...the cars were already beginning to strain at the
corpse of Frank Lloyd Wright.</p>

<p> Angelica Houston tried to deep-throat an axe handle but all she got
was Orson Welles' two hands to smack together until the rings fell of with
the fingers. Her father was no longer at her side. He bobbed for fish with
Fellinni, attempting to do "bubble talk" about just-what-letter-boxing
"means". Fred tried to say "Directors Cut", but it
came out "Didactic Cunt" and Houston gestured toward a school
of minnow attempting to stoop like Monty Cliff eyeing Clark Gable's heart
through the LL Bean chamois Mans Shirt.</p>

<p> Freddy shrugged and tried to smoke, but the cigarettes dissolved and
the match heads turned to white mush. He shrugged and bit off his lower
lip. </p>

<p>All the Roman Cossacks hear confessions in the midst of the pogrom.
All are named Chenko and pull at their nipples with a grace born of white
suspenders and cleansed palms caressing the turnips of open-desire.</p>

<p> In a barn a woman pulls yards of blue satin from her pudenda, pausing
to drink from a black ceramic cock hanging by a thread of golden chains
behind her head. Her laughter is followed by a series of sharp pistol shots
as she reaches orgasm and the cossacks mount their mopeds and strap pink
opalescent peeped-beads to their topknots. All have neck cancer.</p>

<p> It's raining in the north again. Three women on a glass raft burn their
hair for a signal fire and drown in the crusted foam of ice water. This
is on every radio in the metropolitan region but the tri-state area is
buzzing with the news about an old man who died in an apartment and was
found completely eaten by his starving canary, which managed to struggle
through the bars of its cage after a few days off its feed and then consumed
the gent over the course of a Summer, growing moody and compulsive and
angry with each approaching dawn. It was found in the bathroom, looking
into the still water of the toilet, weeping.</p>

<p> The Khmer Rouge tied everyones' hands behind their backs with telephone
wire and marched them into the jungle and started shooting immediately.
Those in front tried to run but there was a kid with a bag of hand grenades
and an M60 and he sprayed them so they'd lay down and he lobbed a couple
of grenades into the bleeding bunched up fucks they died there screaming
for their glasses and dictionaries. The kid sprayed an old mans' head until
it was a pulpy blot and then crisscrossed the dying like it was a fucking
arcade and he heard each shell casing ping as the numbers went into the
hundred thousand and they had to shoot him to get him to stop. He died
happy little fuck with a half eaten centibar in his shirt pocket. </p>

<p>I shot Van Gogh and made him smoke his pipe while I smeared his paintings
with a whore's dentures. This made him laugh: the small cheap bullet lodging
deeper into his pancreas, already sporting a top hat and spats. I spat
on them and demanded a recall. I had lost by only one vote! I tried to
fire again but all I got was a check for 40 million dollars from a Japanese
Corporation with 24k front teeth and a satellite lock on my imagination.</p>

<p> The spooky nylon phantasy: long legs. Fresh pasta draped over a suntanned
ass swelling out from a small silky back. She farts a squeak and adjusts
her sunglasses, attention is everything to detail. I eat the pasta with
a lobster fork made from sized polyester. The flights of terns amuse us.
We laugh and roll off the deck into a cedar-lined pit of iced espresso.
I want to cry out the titles of Antonioni films, but only manage to whistle
the themes and she is amused and fondles my soon to be circumcised cock
in the deep mocha that holds us together like a metaphor.</p>

<p> The darkness of sewer plated patios, piled high into the flight paths
of 747's bringing kraut tourists to get shot in the throttle...everywhere.
The twitching bodies of repeatedly run over by Chimps dressed like Baltimore
Shriners, their little red felt fezes emblazoned with the sequined mock
Arabic...the screams of library-science virgins strapped to miracles in
green glass and steel girders, as boar-shit is stuffed into their colons
by crack-babies high on chewing gum and nitrous oxide...the giggles of
the middleweight tourist. She dipped her fingers into the pool of scented
black oil gathering under her boots and traced out the letters on each
breast: </p>

<p>Orson continued to crawl around the bed, looking for his water pic or
a sandwich....The shells open, slinting glints wet &amp; Mary posed for
Mailer at the Doodle Bar &amp; Grill on the corner of 43rd and 8th while
Gore kept pushing nickels into the bubble juke, pushing buttons at random,
peeking over his shoulder at the bartender who would take down the 1943
Thompson from it's cradle over the bottles behind the bar, and oil it with
a rag he kept in a green glass. Takes all kinds..." Mailer said to
his entourage, holding up the doodle he pretended was his date riding a
large Japanese helmet perched on a chalky bleached skull-bone. "I
was in FUCKING WORLD WAR DEUCE!!!", he screamed.</p>

<p> Gore slipped on a pile of wet Greek fisherman's caps and went down
in a bundle of limbs, hitting his head on the edge of a fire extinguisher.
"Not again...", he moaned with the dignified irony in his voice
that had made him famous in large whitewashed lofts from Dallas to Calgary...pattern
whiffle-walk slow-mo Mongolian Pattern Dance.</p>

<p> A vacation takes place in a tin chalet held in place under a cliff
with blue wax. Real eggs are forsaken for Faberge gold/bisque obules, taken
from the dead fingers of little Anaesthesia as she looked without seeing
as they tore open her delicate chemise to remember how the bullet holes
looked beside the pale grey nipples, the pistols having smashed through
her small, regal back: blood pouched in her downy ass, but no man looked
because all they wanted was her death and the egg and a look at the bloody
holes and nipples long enough to feel their cocks moving.</p>

<p> This is a vacation at the Inner Circle. This is a glazed tattoo over
the retina as one sips prehistoric ice water from a female boot with twelve
inch stainless steel heels etched with your name in runes. The pistol shots
in the lowlands reach up through the wind. What a bore. Amazing grace follows
you like a Hells Angel's babe high on math trying to get you to fuck her
in the ass while her old man is slowly loading a rusted broomhandle with
dum-dums. They you find out he's only passing through, she's really the
grand daughter of Picasso , it's all being filmed by D L and there's a
check waiting for you at your new suite at the Plaza. Someone is following
you... </p>

<p>The troll stole along the camphor bowl implements: That crow, a slow
implement-taster: made a spiny devil befriend the cactus borer's cousin.
The reliable sun, waiting to explode, grew dense and angry...shooting lewd
plumes of fire at the curving time-gaps. Traditional orbits aped the funnel.</p>

<p> Debris fell into oceans. The foal, finally wrapped in the tense light,
leapt higher, catching the leaves of the small scrub brush tree which was
jerked tighter...lighter...in flat ovals of bright yellow light. And yet
that Ape, all hair and arms in obscene panoply, alights the dreary casements
draped in glistening Paradise. The silent lights make orange ardent glint,
and light the leafy keeps of...everything. But the rifle of my loins kept
time with heartbeats, waiting for her soft target to sail back along its
wire : </p>

<p>1. If I could die in my own arms, as sweet as a Bundle of pig's faces
tied with the ropes of imagined desolation! How sweet the final moment!
To feel the strangling womb enclose all fear in the stinking bouquet of
its pathetic DREAM! </p>

<p>2. I can't UNDERSTAND you. You're speaking too loud. My heart aches
for one peaceful moment under a subway train's wheels. My bowels just want
to stretch out their Blue arms along a slippery track and rise up in the
dreary hands of vomiting policemen. </p>

<p>1. I think it may rain sometime in the distant past. Do you? I mean,
can you consider it? You mustn't answer too quickly, or I'll have to dismiss
you as an asshole. </p>

<p>2. Imagine my intestines! The tracks wet with my blood mixed with half
digested hamburgers! The pure luxury of dying in the arms of a dark train
with Large Bold Numbers for a name. Delightful? </p>

<p>1. This is getting us nowhere. </p>

<p>2. Where would you suggest we go? The museum of IDEAS? Dada wants you
to worship at the feet of an Oyster filled with dynamite. I don't feel
your sincerity. You're Lost in Wallpaper again, waiting for white plaster
tombstones to drop out of the sky to give you absolution for wearing sudden
underwear. </p>

<p>1. Haven't you ever look into the dead eye of a slaughtered billionaire?
The way it smells like a painting of derbies fucking on a pool table, on
a wax ball covered with thousand dollar bills? I've walked the hills of
desire with a carbuncle on my heart, weeping for the lost.... </p>

<p>2. That horrible appreciation for the finer things in life. </p>

<p>1. ....weeping for the lost tongues of fried bishops. Besides, "performance
art", like cubism, is a CATHEDRAL OF SHIT. </p>

<p>2. A cheap trick. Besides, I saw it done yesterday, and better. I had
just left the dreary burning wall of gasoline by the butter factory. I
saw a small package and when I opened it, there "it" was. I felt
afraid at first...then I wore it like a hat until it began to scream and
stink. Then I ate it with mustard and wires. It wept inside of my mouth
and made me sad...but the flavor was unusually delicious. </p>

<p>1. I really don't want to hear about it. These aren't pencils. They're
letters from God to his favorite cunt. He loves them. Made a fortune tuning
them against the sound of sucking tornados in movie houses. Are you ready
to sing? </p>

ebony cattle, set with tiny lines of lapis and gold...wires poking out
of glowing eyes. The black sky. Sound of tiny grunts and the sound of grinding.
"Franz!", screamed a small wicker figurine set along the cliff.
They all looked up and ran for the cave entrance. BN poked at the dead
gorilla's shaved back with the tip of his shoe. The ape rolled over the
edge and splashed onto a black rock set with bottles of cheap wine.</p>

<p> The sound woke a sleeping Dwarf-Trooper who ran for cover beneath the
rain soaked logs that edged the spill-off. He checked his haversack: one
Latin grammar, two packets of gum, a long rubber knife and twenty photographs
of a Japanese woman bound with strips of licorice. His little heart stopped
beating on schedule and a filmy web began to emerge from his light blue
ears until he was encased in a tiny cocoon that hardened and cracked. There
was nothing inside but a small bust of Constantine The Great and a handful
of after-dinner mints. </p>

<p>Sapphires? A pile of pale violet doorknobs upon which sat the stuffed
Mole. The taxidermist had used cue balls for the eyes, painting them in
with a swab. He daubed at his paint stained hands with a wad of handy-wipes
and stepped back to admire his work, falling backwards out of the open
window. He knew this was the end and scrubbed at the stubborn flakes of
red paint on his palms.</p>

<p> He crashed onto a pair of delicate men about to embrace. When the coroner
left, and the bodies had been collected, all that remained was a clump
of pink Hindi-wipes in a varicolored stain surrounded by a chalk outline
vaguely resembling a crawling baby.</p>

<p> Suddenly, nothing happened. It burned unattended for a day and two
nights. Then it started again and reached for the stalled supermarket delivery
van. The people eating at the Fish Restaurant noticed and all coughed.
I was just about to smash another oyster against my knee when it began
to rain Big Hats. The monkey, shaved and dressed in a suit of lights, wept
and staggered...staggered weeping like a broken guitar.</p>

dirk in murk surrounded swells to size, It thrills to spill its opals there

spilt the wormy woods with warmest fire Finds love to bind its kind in
rudest tilt Twixt tiny bones assailing through desire. Yet rocks are chains
that bind the sea to turf, Here pounds the melancholy range of captured
surf To toss the timid sand in gritty heaps, And pile the pall of seaweed's
bubbled keeps Against the sweeter strains of Xerxes' lube Which rises in
a spout more tail than tube, The ox is slain and blood spills hot on sand,
Which lies against the rocky arch-ed strand, Here treachery begs lust and
leaves the game, Deflated, flat, to flap upon the main, And chains are
rocks that bind the meat to surf, In gritty heaps that sprout along the
turf, A bladder floats in softly on that tide, A melancholy bubble hid
inside. </p>

<p>A brilliant tin bubble of pure light, traveling at top speed since the
dawn of time struck him full on the forehead and that-was-that. He didn't
feel the change, although at the time he suddenly wanted to get up and
walk about in the room. And he did so, carrying his large red cup of coffee
to the doorway and he promptly laid back in the full, robust air behind
him and floated to the ceiling. "This will not do..", his friend
Bud said in a nearly offensive tone that echoed in Wally's brain and sped
along the chapters of his imagination, settling, finally, in a slightly
cool section of his mind reserved for apricot recipes and the distances
between ancient capitol cities. In effect, it was instantly forgotten,
half- registered as he floated against the ceiling and could smell the
dust and soft cigarette smoke. He wanted to remove his clothing and pulled
off his sweater and shoes, and in the manner of a scuba diver feeling his
way along the underside of submerged object, softly pawed his way toward
the open window. What would happen - he thought- when I reach the open
air? He imagined a flavor. It seemed perfectly natural to him.</p>

<p> It was the tin bubble. It had filled him with an easy awe as it turned
off the dulling memories that make up reverie. Usual reverie, that is.
He reached the window and pushed softly off the ceiling and thought himself
out into the lighted air, carrying himself slowly upward, upright. It was
then that he realized he was, indeed, not alone. For beside him "stood"
a small lucent figure, himself at four or five. "I'm you at four or
five.", said the figure, nodding and smiling. Wally took the boy in
his arms and they descended to within an few inches of the small patch
of grassy yard planted with wax begonias and sweet Williams. The light
in his brain had made him hungry and he inhaled all the flavors he could
think of and began to feel warm. Light had begun to spin out the breath
of his hair.</p>

<p> Bud was leaning out the window. "Who's that?" said Bud and
the boy. At that moment they canceled each other out, virtual question-particles
at the event horizon Wally thought like a bird singing and made a sound
like snow slipping from an infinitely polished copper roof into a delicately
spun fan of soft, dark green pine needles. It was beautiful - he thought
and now it flowed from his face as a sheet of blue and orange flame, smelling
like a bell shimmering at midnight.
