<h1>Piano {%noun:$man,proper} <small>originally by Billy Joel</small></h1>
<br/>
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday<br/>
The {%adjective} {%noun_compound} shuffles in<br/>
There's {%adjective:article} {%noun} {%verb:present} next to me<br/>
Makin' love to his {%noun} and {%noun}<br/>
<br/>
He says, "Son, can you play me a {%noun}<br/>
I'm not really sure how it goes<br/>
But it's {%adjective} and it's {%adjective} and I knew it complete<br/>
When I wore a younger man's {%noun:plural}."<br/>
<br/>
La la la, di da da<br/>
La la, di da da da dum<br/>
<br/>
Sing us a {%noun:$song}, you're the piano {$man}<br/>
Sing us a {$song} tonight<br/>
Well, we're all in the mood for {%noun:article,$melody}<br/>
And you've got us {%verb:present,$feeling} alright<br/>
<br/>
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine<br/>
He gets me my {%noun:plural} for free<br/>
And he's quick with a {%noun} or to light up your {%noun}<br/>
But there's someplace that he'd rather be<br/>
He says, "Bill, I believe this is {%verb:present} me."<br/>
As the {%noun} ran away from his face<br/>
"Well I'm sure that I could be a {%adjective} {%noun}<br/>
If I could get out of this place"<br/>
<br/>
Oh, la la la, di da da<br/>
La la, di da da da dum<br/>
<br/>
Now Paul is {%noun_compound:article}<br/>
Who never had {%noun:article} for a wife<br/>
And he's {%verb:present} with Davy, who's {%verb:plural} in the Navy<br/>
And probably will be for life<br/>
<br/>
And the waitress is {%verb:present} {%noun:plural}<br/>
As the {%noun:plural} slowly get stoned<br/>
Yes, they're sharing a {%noun} they call loneliness<br/>
But it's better than {%verb:present} alone<br/>
<br/>
Sing us a {$song} you're the piano {$man}<br/>
Sing us a {$song} tonight<br/>
Well we're all in the mood for {$melody}<br/>
And you got us {$feeling} alright<br/>
<br/>
It's a pretty good {%noun} for a Saturday<br/>
And the manager gives me a {%noun_compound}<br/>
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to {%verb}<br/>
To forget about {%noun} for a while<br/>
And the {%noun_compound}, it sounds like a carnival<br/>
And the microphone smells like {%noun:article}<br/>
And they sit at the bar and put {%noun} in my {%noun}<br/>
And say, "Man, what are you {%verb:present} here?"<br/>
<br/>
Oh, la la la, di da da<br/>
La la, di da da da dum<br/>
<br/>
Sing us a {$song} you're the piano {$man}<br/>
Sing us a {$song} tonight<br/>
Well we're all in the mood for {$melody}<br/>
And you got us {$feeling} alright<br/>
