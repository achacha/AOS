<h1>"Before The {%noun:$dawn,proper}" <small>originally by Judas Priest</small></h1>
<br/>
Before the {$dawn}, I hear you {%verb:$wisper}<br/>
In your sleep "don't let the {%noun:$morning} {%verb:$take} him"<br/>
Outside the birds begin to call<br/>
As if to summon up my leaving<br/>
<br/>
It's been a {%noun:$lifetime} since I found someone<br/>
Since I found someone who would {%verb:$stay}<br/>
I've waited too long, and now you're {%verb:present,$leaving}<br/>
Oh please don't {$take} it all away<br/>
