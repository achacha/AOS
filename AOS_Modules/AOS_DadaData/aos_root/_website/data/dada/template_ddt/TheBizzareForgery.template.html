<h1>The {$subject}</h1>
<br/>
Once upon a {%adjective} dreary, while I {%verb:past} weak and weary,<br/>
Over many a quaint and curious {%noun} of forgotten {%noun},<br/>
While I {%verb:past}, nearly {%verb:present}, suddenly there came a {%verb:present},<br/>
As of some one {%adverb} rapping, rapping at my {%noun} {%noun}.<br/>
`'Tis some {%noun},' I muttered, `{%verb:present} at my {%noun} {%noun:$door} -<br/>
Only this, and nothing more.'<br/>
<br/>
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the {%adjective} December,<br/>
And each separate {%verb:present} ember wrought its {%noun} upon the {%noun}.<br/>
Eagerly I {%verb:past} the morrow; - {%adverb} I had sought to {%verb}<br/>
From my {%noun:plural} surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost {%noun_proper:$lenore} -<br/>
For the {%adjective} and {%adjective} {%noun} whom the {%noun:plural} named {$lenore} -<br/>
Nameless here for evermore.<br/>
<br/>
And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br/>
Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br/>
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br/>
`'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber {$door} -<br/>
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber {$door}; -<br/>
This it is, and nothing more,'<br/>
<br/>
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br/>
`Sir,' said I, `or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br/>
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br/>
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber {$door},<br/>
That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the {$door}; -<br/>
Darkness there, and nothing more.<br/>
<br/>
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there {%verb:present}, fearing,<br/>
Doubting, dreaming dreams no {%noun} ever dared to dream before<br/>
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,<br/>
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, `{$lenore}!'<br/>
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, `{$lenore}!'<br/>
Merely this and nothing more.<br/>
<br/>
Back into the chamber turning, all my {%noun} within me burning,<br/>
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br/>
`Surely,' said I, `surely that is something at my window lattice;<br/>
Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -<br/>
Let my {%noun} be still a moment and this mystery explore; -<br/>
'Tis the wind and nothing more!'<br/>
<br/>
Open here I flung the {%noun}, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br/>
In there stepped a stately {$subject:lowercase} of the saintly days of yore.<br/>
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br/>
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber {$door} -<br/>
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber {$door} -<br/>
Perched, and {%verb}, and nothing more.<br/>
<br/>
Then this {%adjective} {%noun} beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br/>
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br/>
`Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, `art sure no craven.<br/>
Ghastly grim and ancient {$subject:lowercase} wandering from the nightly {%noun:$shore} -<br/>
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian {$shore}!'<br/>
Quoth the {$subject:lowercase}, `Nevermore.'<br/>
<br/>
Much I marvelled this ungainly {%noun} to hear discourse so plainly,<br/>
Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore;<br/>
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br/>
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber {$door} -<br/>
Bird or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber {$door},<br/>
With such name as `Nevermore.'<br/>
<br/>
But the {$subject:lowercase}, {%verb:present} lonely on the placid bust, spoke only,<br/>
That one word, as if his {%noun} in that one word he did outpour.<br/>
Nothing further then he uttered - not a {%noun} then he fluttered -<br/>
Till I scarcely more than muttered `Other {%noun:plural} have flown before -<br/>
On the morrow will he leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'<br/>
Then the {%noun} said, `Nevermore.'<br/>
<br/>
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br/>
`Doubtless,' said I, `what it utters is its only stock and store,<br/>
Caught from some unhappy c whom unmerciful disaster<br/>
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -<br/>
Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore<br/>
Of "Never-nevermore."'<br/>
<br/>
But the {$subject:lowercase} still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<br/>
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and {$door};<br/>
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br/>
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore -<br/>
What this grim, ungainly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br/>
Meant in croaking `Nevermore.'<br/>
<br/>
This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br/>
To the fowl whose fiery {%noun:plural} now burned into my bosom's {%noun};<br/>
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br/>
On the cushion's velvet violet lining that the lamp-light gloated {%noun:$oer},<br/>
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating {$oer},<br/>
She shall press, ah, nevermore!<br/>
<br/>
Then, methought, the air grew denser, {%verb:past} from an unseen censer<br/>
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls {%verb:past} on the tufted floor.<br/>
`Wretch,' I cried, `thy {$noun_proper} hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee<br/>
Respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of {$lenore}!<br/>
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost {$lenore}!'<br/>
Quoth the {$subject:lowercase}, `Nevermore.'<br/>
<br/>
`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! -<br/>
Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br/>
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -<br/>
On this {%noun} by horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore -<br/>
Is there - is there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!'<br/>
Quoth the {$subject:lowercase}, `Nevermore.'<br/>
<br/>
`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil!<br/>
By that {%noun} that bends above us - by that {%noun} we both adore -<br/>
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br/>
It shall clasp a {%verb:past} maiden whom the angels named {$lenore} -<br/>
Clasp a rare and radiant {%noun}, whom the angels {%verb:past} {$lenore}?'<br/>
Quoth the {$subject:lowercase}, `Nevermore.'<br/>
<br/>
`Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I shrieked upstarting -<br/>
`Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian {$shore}!<br/>
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br/>
Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my {$door}!<br/>
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my {$door}!'<br/>
Quoth the {$subject:lowercase}, `Nevermore.'<br/>
<br/>
And the {$subject:lowercase}, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br/>
On the pallid {%noun} of Pallas just above my chamber {$door};<br/>
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,<br/>
And the lamp-light {$oer} him streaming throws his shadow on the {%noun:$floor};<br/>
And my soul from out that {%noun} that lies floating on the {$floor}<br/>
Shall be {%verb:past} - nevermore!<br/>
