compling zlib
had to download masm from microsoft to compile zlib. It turns out that zlib assembly has 4 compile errors that have to be fixed by hand:

inffas32.asm(647) : error A2070: invalid instruction operands
inffas32.asm(649) : error A2070: invalid instruction operands
inffas32.asm(663) : error A2070: invalid instruction operands
inffas32.asm(720) : error A2070: invalid instruction operands

All these are due to the same problem. Found the following fix online:

- movd mm7,[esi]
+ movd mm7,dword ptr[esi]
