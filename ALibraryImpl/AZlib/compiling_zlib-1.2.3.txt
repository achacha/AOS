compling zlib 1.2.3

1. Test build the ASM code from the appropriate contrib directory.

  a. For x86 the following fix is needed:
        had to download masm from microsoft to compile zlib. It turns out that zlib assembly has 4 compile errors that have to be fixed by hand:

        inffas32.asm(647) : error A2070: invalid instruction operands
        inffas32.asm(649) : error A2070: invalid instruction operands
        inffas32.asm(663) : error A2070: invalid instruction operands
        inffas32.asm(720) : error A2070: invalid instruction operands

        All these are due to the same problem. Found the following fix online:

        - movd mm7,[esi]
        + movd mm7,dword ptr[esi] 

  b. x64 version worked fine using bld_ml64.bat

2. Unzip visualc9-x86 to zlib123/projects directory and build wuth Visual Studio 2008+

3. Unzip visualc9-x64 to the zlib123/projects directory and build with Visual Studio 2008+

4. DEBUG from    x64/DLL ASM Debug
   RELEASE from  x64/DLL ASM Release
