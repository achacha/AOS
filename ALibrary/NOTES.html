Design Guidelines used during development
=========================================

- Non-const pointers passed as parameters to methods are assumed to be objects that will be owned by this and cleanup appropriately.
  void MyClass::set(Object* pObject);   // Here the pObject will be owned and cleaned up by MyClass
  myclassObject.set(new Object);        // This is always safe and will not leak

- Const pointers passed as parameters to methods will be used and/or copied but never owned

- Access members will be in the form of setSomething/getSomething/useSomething
  get returns a copy of the parameter or a constant refernce and assumes a const object
    - Something getSomething() const;
    - const Something& getSomething() const;  
  set modifies the parameter  
    - void setSomething(const Something s);
  use returns a modifiable reference to the parameter 
    - Something& useSomething();

- clone() method always returns a pointer to a duplicate that the called has to own and delete


Build notes
===========
- Use Multi-threaded Debug DLL and Multi-threaded DLL for runtime

make_distribution.py <target path> [verbose | clean] - will do everything.
  create_distribution.py <target path> [verbose | clean] - gathers headers, external binaries and if path is not .. then initernal binaries
  gather_headers_only.py <target path> [verbose | clean] - gathers headers only
  build_distribution.py <debug|release|all> <build|rebuild|clean> - invokes MSDEV
