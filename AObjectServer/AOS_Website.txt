Creating an empty AOS modules project=====================================1. Uncompress the archive as a peer to AObjectServer folder2. Rename AOS_Website to something else if you plan on having more that one3. Read new_AOS_Project.HOWTO.txt on creating your first project4. Open AOS_Website.sln with Visual Studio 2008 or later5. Add your new project created with new_AOS_Project.py and make AObjectServer depend on it (so it is build before it)6. Set  AObjectServer as the startup project7. Edit AObjectServer Properties 	  Debugging | Working Directory = $(TargetDir)	  Debugging | Command Arguements = ../AOS_Website/aos_root   (or whatever you named your directory)8. Build AObjectServer9. Run AObjectServerNOTE: AObjectServer depends on AOS_BaseModules which depend on AOS_Base      (You don't need AOS_Base or AOS_BaseModules in the solution but it makes it easier to debug the server)Executing AObjectServer against your new website================================================Point AObjectServer into your new aos_root directory:  AObjectServer ../AOS_Website/aos_root
