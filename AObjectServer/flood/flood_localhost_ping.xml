<!-- Hi, I'm a flood config file.  They call me "round-robin.xml"
     I am an example of a "round-robin" configuration.  All of the URLs in
     the urllist "Test Hosts" will be hit in sequential order.  
     Flood's syntax is XML based.  
     After compiling flood (./configure && make), you can execute me as:
     ./flood examples/round-robin.xml
     (The path to me.)

     Flood will then output data to stdout in the format as specified below 
     (relative_times) for each URL that it hits:
     998951597871780 1389 57420 7960273 7960282 OK  4 http://www.apache.org/
     The columns are as follows:
     - Absolute Time in usec that the request was started by flood
     - Relative Time in usec (to first column) that it took to open the socket
       to the specified server
     - Relative Time in usec (to first column) that it took to write the
       generated request to the server.
     - Relative Time in usec (to first column) that it took to read the
       generated response from the server.
     - Relative Time in usec (to first column) that it took to close the
       socket.  On a keepalive socket, it may not close the socket.
     - OK/FAIL indicates what the verification module (in this case, 
       verify_200) thought of the request.
     - The thread/process id of the farmer that made the request.
     - The URL that was hit (without query strings)

     To get a "nice" summary of the output (as well as an idea of how to
     further process this info), try out:
     ./flood examples/round-robin.xml > my-output
     ./examples/analyze-relative my-output
