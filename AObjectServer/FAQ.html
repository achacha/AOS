<h3>What does make_aosconfig.py do?</h3>
It will walk through the '../ALibrary/aosconfig/' and '../AOS_Modules/aosconfig/' and synchronize the content to both '../_debug' and '../release'.
This is how you publish content to the execution area.  It allows you to develop content "offline" and then synchronize it with running configuration.
Important note is that aos_dynamic is parsed on start-up and will not be read again (not yet anyhow, there will be an admin function to force a reparse of command eventually).
ON the other hand aos_static is not cached and will be read everytime (caching may be added here and refresh will be added to admin at that time).
aos_data is controlled by the modules (if used) and is implementation specific (you dictate how the data gets read/stored).

<h3>How do I shut AObjectServer down?</h3>
Graceful exit can be done by simply pointing your brownser to the admin site and clicking the shutdown link.  Default is http://127.0.0.1:12346/

<h3>Why doesn't my newly created module show up when I add it to the module list in my .aos.xml file?</h3>
AObjectServer dynamically registers modules, it will check the .ini file for which module libraries to load and call aos_init and aos_register for each one.
Each module library has an aos_register() function that registers its modules with the server.  This allows you to control what gets exposed to the world.<br/>
Inside aos_register() you can register input processors, modules and output generators with appropriate executor.<br/>
Look in a file {projectname}.cpp  (e.g. AOS_Example.cpp in ./AOS_Example/ project).<br/>
You will need to:<br/>
1. add #include for your new module<br/>
2. add the register call to the init function<br/>
<br/>
<pre>
...

<b>#include "AOSModule_mymodule.hpp"   // Step1. you add your header include</b>

...

extern "C" AOS_EXAMPLE_API int aos_register(
  AOSInputExecutor& inputExecutor, 
  AOSModuleExecutor& moduleExecutor, 
  AOSOutputExecutor& outputExecutor, 
  ALog& alog
)
{
  alog.add(ASWNL("AOS_MyProject: aos_register"), ALog::INFO);

  //Register modules
  
  ...
  
  <b>moduleExecutor.registerModule(new AOSModule_mymodule(alog));  // Step2. Add to AOS registration</b>
  
  return 0;
}
