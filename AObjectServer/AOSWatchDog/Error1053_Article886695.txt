SYMPTOMS
Services that use the local system account to log on to a Microsoft Windows Server 2003-based computer do not start. By default, services such as the following use the local system account to log on:
•	World Wide Web Publishing Service
•	Microsoft Windows Installer
•	Microsoft Windows Management Instrumentation
After such a service tries to start, you receive the following error message:
Error 1053: The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.
Note Typically, this error message does not appear until after a 30-second time-out.

After an indeterminate time after you restart your computer, services that are running under the local system account fail to start. For example, after a period of 12 hours to 5 days, a service such as Windows Installer fails to start. In this case, the error message is returned immediately instead of after the usual 30-second time-out.

You may also receive the following error message:
DLL Initialization failure (0xc0000142)

CAUSE
This problem occurs because the Iisutil.dll DLL adds an access control entry (ACE) to the desktop security descriptor for the services that run in the system context. The ACE lets the Microsoft Internet Information Services Worker Process Group (IIS_WPG) account log on to the system service desktop. However, if another process sets the desktop security descriptor for the services that run in the system context to a null value, Iisutil.dll changes the discretionary access control list (DACL). Iisutil.dll changes the DACL list so that any service that uses the noninteractive local system account cannot log on.

Note The noninteractive local system account is the local system account that does not use the Allow service to interact with desktop option. For additional information about this option, see the "More Information" section.

Note A null value security descriptor grants unrestricted access.
