Change Log
----------

1.6.0.0:
- Major reorganization of the aos_root directory to handle localization better
- I18n locale support via localized data and static directories and configuration to remap locales
- SetSessionLocale module added to allow setting a locale for a user which is written to the request header's Accept-Languages: token
- Added RESOURCE token for templates to support locale based resources
- AHTTPHeader and sub-classes handle headers with multiple field names; added string constant names used in HTTP fields
- Added partial output JSON emit (based on path(s) it outputs object or array) and made it a bit smarter when outputing JSON property with only content
- .json as a supported extension type (with associated MIME type in mime_types.ini)
- New XML step can output entire model or object(s) based on path (originally XML was a default coded into output executor)
- Added client-side XSLT support for XML step
- Fixed memory leak in File output generator
- Added better filename choice to MsXslt output generator
- AAutoPtr::oprator! added
- AXmlDocument::clearAll removed, AXmlDocument::clear now handles all cases, <?xml> is retained in all clears
- Improved session data handling

- Upgraded to Lua 5.1.4

1.5.0.3:
- Cleaned up history clearing via admin
- Fixed small memory leak
- Minor fixed to web admin console
- Better error reporting when SQLite3 database file is not found
- aos_root moved up one directory to be a peer to the output directories (so it can be shared by debug and release without sync)
- Improved parsing of listener socket init data
- Moved all module configs to ./aos_root/conf/autoload and will load a module corresponding the config name (AOS_MyModule.xml will load AOS_MyModule.dll automatically)


1.5.0.2:
- Moved aos_root up one directory to be parallel with release and debug directories (allows for a common config/site to be used by both debug and release)
- Moved AObjectDatabase.db (SQLite3 database) into aos_root/db directory (from aos_root/)
- Cleaned up examples and sample site
