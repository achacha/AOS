Change Log
----------

1.5.0.3:
- Cleaned up history clearing via admin
- Fixed small memory leak
- Minor fixed to web admin console
- Better error reporting when SQLite3 database file is not found
- aos_root moved up one directory to be a peer to the output directories (so it can be shared by debug and release without sync)
- Improved parsing of listener socket init data
- Moved all module configs to ./aos_root/conf/autoload and will load a module corresponding the config name (AOS_MyModule.xml will load AOS_MyModule.dll automatically)

1.5.0.2:
- Moved aos_root up one directory to be parallel with release and debug directories (allows for a common config/site to be used by both debug and release)
- Moved AObjectDatabase.db (SQLite3 database) into aos_root/db directory (from aos_root/)
- Cleaned up examples and sample site
